    <h2><em>The Daleks</em></h2>

      title="Exterminate"/>
      <p>The Daleks were a warrior race made up of genetically engineered mutants belonging to fundamental DNA type 467-989. By most accounts they were originally from the planet Skaro. The mutants were encased inside an armoured travel machine built from polycarbide and the metal Dalekanium. </p>
       <p> On many occasions, the Daleks openly acknowledged a single Time Lord, the Doctor, as their greatest enemy. The Doctor described them likewise, and, in their tenth incarnation, stated that a Dalek was "not just metal, it was alive," that "inside that shell, there a creature born to hate, whose only thought to destroy everything and everyone that a Dalek, too." The Tenth Doctor also noted that from birth, the Daleks were encased in a cold metal shell unable to feel anything, claiming that was why they "screamed." The War Doctor also said that Daleks were "not robots", but "savage, incredibly intelligent, living, breathing creatures housed inside a war tank". </p>
    <p> The Daleks fought the Time Lords in the Last Great Time War, ending in the near-total destruction of the Dalek race until they rebuilt and restored their empire. Intensely xenophobic and bent on universal domination, the Daleks were hated and feared throughout time and space. Their goal was to eradicate all non-Dalek life, as programmed by their creator. </p>

    <h2><em>Cyberman</em></h2>

    width="300" 
    title="You will be UPGRATED"/>
    <P>The Cybermen were a "race" of cybernetically augmented humanoids. They varied greatly in design between numerous different Cyber-subspecies, and originated independently through parallel evolution from various locations across time, space and universes, including Mondas, Telos, Planet 14, Marinus, a Mondasian colony ship, the Earths of the Doctor's universe and "Pete's World", and at least one other parallel universe.</p>
    <p>Although almost all Cybermen lacked emotions, as they considered them to be a weakness and instead embraced pure logic, they were often born out of a human civilisation's, or an individual's, fear for survival, which was often inflicted by threats such as poverty or the degradation of a civilisation's world. Other times, the Cybermen were born out of an extreme desire for immortality. Through the misuse of Cyber-Technology, Cybermen could be born on other worlds even if a civilisation was not burdened by threats to survival, such as on Samotis, Centuria and Catrigan Nova.</p>
<p>  Due to parallel evolution, there were numerous similarities and differences between groups of Cybermen; most lacked names or individuality beyond a rank, and all sought to fully conquer their respective universes to ensure their survival and "upgrade" all "compatible" life forms to ensure those beings survived as well. Some sought to conquer other universes as well, or even the entire multiverse. Unable to naturally breed themselves, the Cybermen most often attempted to achieve these goals via a process called cyber-conversion, the physical and mental re-engineering of organic lifeforms, often humans and humanoids with similar biologies, into Cybermen.</p>
<p> Throughout their collective history, the Cybermen established many Cyber-Empires and engaged in many different Cyber-Wars, often against humanity, which eventually led to the Cybermen being pushed to the edge of extinction. However, they always found ways to survive and rebuild, ultimately allowing the Cybermen to survive until the end of the universe.

    <h2><em>Weeping Angels</em></h2>
    <img src="./images/angels.webp"
    width="300" 
    title="DON'T BLINK"/>
    <p>The Weeping Angels were an incredibly powerful species of quantum-locked humanoids, so called because their unique nature necessitated that they often covered their faces with their hands to prevent trapping each other in petrified form for eternity by looking at one another.</p> 
    <p>They were known for being "kind" murderous psychopaths, eradicating their victims "mercifully" by dropping them into the past and letting them live out their full lives, just in a different time period. This, in turn, allowed them to live off the remaining time energy of the victim's life. </p>
    <p>However, when this potential energy paled in comparison to an alternative power source to feed on, the Angels were known to kill by other means, such as snapping their victims' necks.</p>

    <h2><em>Silents</em></h2>
    <img src="./images/Silent.webp"
    width="300" 
    title="This WORLD is OURS. We have RULED it since THE WHEEL and THE FIRE"/>
    <p>The Silence, known singularly as a Silentand formerly known as the Confessional Priests of the Papal Mainframe, were genetically engineered by the Church to allow people to confess their sins without remembering doing so, accomplished by fashioning the Priests so anyone looking at them would forget their encounter when they looked away A renegade sect of Priests became obsessed with preventing the Siege of Trenzalore, and travelled back in time, influencing human history over a long period of time, and attempting to create a fixed death for the Doctor at Lake Silencio.</p>
    <p>They were tall humanoids, around seven feet tall, with bulbous heads and grey, mouthless faces. Their hands had four large, spatulate fingers. They had small eyes in deep recesses in the skull. Their eyes lacked sclera and were completely dark.</p>
<p>The Silents remained hidden on Earth for hundreds of thousands of years, since the early Stone Age. They were uniquely "memory-proof"; anyone who saw them would instantly forget about them the moment they looked away â€” even if they saw a photograph of a Silent. Anyone looking at the Silents would recover their memories of previous sightings. The amnesia appeared to take a few seconds before it took effect.</p>
